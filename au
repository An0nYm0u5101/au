# directory has been created on your device. Change /sdcard/debs to a 
# micro SD destination to save space on device if available. 
# IMPORTANT: Uncomment the next apt install line to automate 
# installing into au if on high speed connection. Moving the next apt 
# line between lines 10 & 11 (apt update... & mv...) is preferred:
# apt -o APT::Keep-Downloaded-Packages="true" install $@ -y
