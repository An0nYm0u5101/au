You can use [`au` ðŸ“² ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdrausty/au/master/au) to backup you installation files in [Termux,](https://github.com/termux) i.e. debs. If you find your system unstable after updating, you can try to use `dpkg --purge pkg_name` and then `dpkg --install pkg_name` from `/sdcard/debs` to downgrade packages to a previous version of a package in the hope of regaining system stability in [Termux.](https://github.com/termux)

You should use [`au`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdrausty/au/master/au) from your `$PATH`. To see your `$PATH`, type `$PATH` +enter/return. Then use `mv au destination_directory` to move `au` to your `$PATH`. `au` +enter/return will update and backup your [Termux](https://termux.com/) in three keystrokes!

Every time you want to `apt update && apt upgrade` or `pkg up`, you shall also be backing up your former installation debs to `/sdcard/debs` by using `au`. Ideally, you should change `/sdcard/debs` to an external mirco SD card destination in lines 9 and 11 of au to save space on device.

If you find your system unstable, you can use `dpkg --purge pkg_name` and then `dpkg --install pkg_name` from `/sdcard/debs` to downgrade packages to a previous version of a package in the hope of regaining package stability. 

Important: Please use `apt -o APT::Keep-Downloaded-Packages="true" install package_name(s)` to populate your backup directory in conjunction with [`au`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdrausty/au/master/au) to ensure that you can enjoy a full backup of `*.deb` files on device. 

Message to https://github.com/Grimler91 I have stepped on the ancient cobblestones in the capital, north of Stockholm. You enticed me to contribute. Then you, with others, deleted my hard effort, my work numerous times before I became aware of your destructive actions towards Termux development. Later you banned my account from Termux. @Grimler91, you and your team are keeping Termux away from Wikipedia, and guess what, I know why. You wanna my latex academic literature, and my smartphone bitcoins, Swedish liaison! My academic literature is not to be stolen/deleted by you and your Termuxed deb packages!

Message to https://github.com/fornwall DITTO. Do you like being the stooge? Too lazy to merge pull requests? Or is it, no ones rooted, and I cannot get the bitcoins and bounce a Tesla autodrive?

Message to https://github.com/Neo-Oli DITTO without Sweden encouraging me to root my stuff, just you and your team encouraging me to root away my Android citadel from Switzerland!

Message to https://github.com/xeffyr DITTO without Sweden encouraging me to root my stuff, just you and your group encouraging me to root away my Android castle from the Ukraine!

Did you wanna root my device to getta my BITCOINS, my Tesla autodrive? @Grimler91 BITCOINS+literature? You know, latex is elastic. Read my work through your Termuxed latex *.deb? I think not @Grimler91. Neo-Oli the Swiss banker, can you please confirm? Or are you and your team camping far away from us in the Alpine Mountains with other people's bitcoins?

You didn't like the timings, did you? I did not like them at all. Why is Termux slower? Degustamos rooted bitcoins?

Listen; https://github.com/sdrausty/sdrausty.github.io/blob/master/audio/alphaV.webm?raw=true Possibly you shall comprehend. Possibly.

You are welcome to reply to my public statement. As you know, I have been using Termux software since it arrived. After years of using (coof coof) your open source software (does it compile?) I have a firm opinion about you. If it doesn't compile, what are you feeding me? Why are you wasting my time? To get my autodrive, my bitcoins? Why doesn't it compile from the source code that you publish?
